# AI-Powered Smart Waste Management System

## Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Smart Waste Management System** uses **computer vision**, **machine learning (ML)**, and **reinforcement learning (RL)** to revolutionize urban waste management. The system detects waste and spills in real time through **CCTV surveillance** and automatically allocates tasks to cleanup crews. Additionally, it enables public participation through an interactive reporting map with gamified rewards, driving civic engagement and improving issue resolution efficiency.

## Features
- **Real-time Waste & Spill Detection:**  
  Uses **AI-powered CCTV** to identify garbage and spills with **95%+ accuracy**.

- **Automated Task Allocation:**  
  Utilizes a **reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithm for efficient task allocation, reducing response time by **40%**.

- **Public Reporting System:**  
  An interactive map allows citizens to report waste, enabling faster issue resolution and improving coordination with **facility management**.

- **Gamified Rewards:**  
  Incentivizes public participation by offering rewards for reporting waste, increasing engagement by **70%**.

- **Real-time Communication:**  
  Ensures seamless communication between facility management and cleanup teams for efficient task execution.

## How It Works

1. **CCTV Footage Streaming:**  
   The **CCTV cameras** stream live footage to the backend, where **computer vision algorithms** analyze the video feed for waste and spills.

2. **Waste Detection with Machine Learning:**  
   **Machine Learning models** predict and identify waste locations, sending the detected data to the backend for task assignment.

3. **Automated Task Allocation with Reinforcement Learning:**  
   The **reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithm efficiently allocates cleanup tasks to available crews based on proximity and workload, optimizing response time.

4. **Public Reporting System:**  
   Citizens can report waste or spills via an **interactive map**, which syncs in real time with facility management teams for faster resolution.

5. **Gamified Rewards for Participation:**  
   When users report waste, they earn **Greencoins** through the **gamified rewards system**, incentivizing participation and improving urban cleanliness.
